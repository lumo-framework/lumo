# Deploy to AWS using OIDC (Recommended)
#
# To set up OIDC authentication with AWS:
# 1. Follow the AWS documentation: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_providers_create_oidc.html
# 2. Create an OIDC identity provider in AWS IAM with:
#    - Provider URL: https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com
#    - Audience: sts.amazonaws.com
# 3. Create an IAM role with the necessary permissions for your deployment
# 4. Add the role ARN to your GitHub repository secrets as AWS_ROLE_ARN
#
# Benefits of OIDC over access keys:
# - No long-lived credentials to manage
# - More secure as tokens are short-lived
# - Better audit trail and role-based access control
